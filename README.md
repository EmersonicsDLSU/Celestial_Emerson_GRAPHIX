# Celestial_Emerson_GRAPHIX

This is one of my class projects where we're assigned to create a virtual museum of any environment. The program's platform is 3D and in the program, the player has a free look mechanic and "wasd" movement. The texture's shader has a normal map feature that makes the texture more realistic. Lighting feature is also shown in the game where it highlights different types of lights: point light, direct light, spotlight. The program also has a skybox where it simulates a moving sky that transforms from morning to nighttime.
